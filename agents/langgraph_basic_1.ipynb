            "\n",
            "**\"LLMks\"** likely refers to **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in the context of **Dr. Karthik Mohan**, an instructor at the University of Washington who teaches masterclasses on LLMs and AI like ChatGPT. Here’s a quick breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **What are LLMs?**  \n",
            "   Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text. They can generate human-like text, write code, answer questions, or draft emails.  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Karthik’s Role**  \n",
            "   Dr. Karthik Mohan is an expert who teaches courses about LLMs—covering how they work, their applications (e.g., creativity, data analysis), and their limitations (e.g., struggles with reasoning, planning, or nuanced tasks).  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Key Points from the Search Results**  \n",
            "   - LLMs are powerful but not perfect (e.g., they “average” knowledge and can’t deeply reason).  \n",
            "   - **Prompt engineering** (crafting precise inputs) is vital to get good results.  \n",
            "   - They’re used in diverse fields, from storytelling (e.g., Tamil-language models) to AI agents.  \n",
            "\n",
            "In short: If you meant **LLMs**, they’re AI tools that mimic human language, and **Karthik Mohan** is an educator helping people master their use. If you meant something else by \"LLMks,\" feel free to clarify! 😊\n",
