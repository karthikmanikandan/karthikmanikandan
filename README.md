# 🏦 Bank of Boubyan – Login Page (HTML & CSS)



A **static banking login page UI** built using **HTML and CSS**, created as my **first frontend project** during my internship period.

This project helped me transition from a **backend-only mindset** to gaining confidence as a **full-stack developer**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

During my internship at **Intellect Design Arena** *(August – October)*, I was primarily working as a **backend developer**.

In my free time, one of my seniors encouraged me to:

> “Try building a UI from scratch to understand the frontend perspective.”

This project was my **first attempt at frontend development**, and completing it gave me:

* Confidence in UI building
* Better understanding of full-stack workflows
* Motivation to explore frontend + backend together
